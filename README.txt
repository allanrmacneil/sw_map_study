This is the semi-organised version of the code for computing mapping longitude offsets using HCS crossings at 1 au and PFSS models.

The environment .yml file is not the exact env I am running, but has what I have estimated to be the necessary packages. 

Run HCS_mapping.ipynb to get the mapping offsets 

Then run mapping_paperplots to make most of the plots that went in the paper.

The code options should work in order to download all the data, but that is very large and goes slowly. There are intermediate data products with code to download from google drive included in these scripts.
